The function RunVimTmuxCommand(command) is the core of Vimux. It will
create a split pane in the current window and run the passed command in it.

    :call RunVimTmuxCommand("ls")

This will run the command in a split pane without losing focus of vim. If the
command takes a long time to return you can continue to use vim while the
process finishes and will see the output in the pane when it's finished. Check
out http://github.com/benmills/vimux for more information and updates.
